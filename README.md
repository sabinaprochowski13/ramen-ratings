# Ramen Ratings Project
Using a dataset of over 2500 ramen reviews, I tested which countries have the highest ramen ratings. I wanted to test if Asian countries have the best ramen since it originated from there. Note that best is subjective and was measured as highest rated (from 1 to 5) based on the data gathered in this project.

This project was completed via Jupyter Notebook and uses multiple Python libraries like pandas, numpy, matplotlib, Scikit-Learn, stats model, etc.
