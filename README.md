# Ramen Ratings Project üçú
Using a dataset of over 2500 ramen reviews, I tested which countries have the highest ramen ratings. I wanted to test if Asian countries have the best ramen since it originated from there. Note that best is subjective and was measured as highest rated (from 1 to 5) based on the data gathered in this project. I also find if there was a relationship between the distance from Asia with the average star rating for each country, but find that the data used for this project has some limitations and would need further integration of other data/research to completely capture that relation. I build on this further in the report, specifically in part 2. 

This project was completed via Jupyter Notebook and uses multiple Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn, statsmodel, etc. This was my final project for my "Data Science for Everyone" course at New York University.
